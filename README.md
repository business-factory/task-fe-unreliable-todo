# ROI Hunter frontend task

## The task

Your task is to create a simple backend-connected TODO app.

Your app needs to support all CRUD operations on TODO items.  
There also needs to be a session control component.  
The TODOs have to be filterable.

The level of polish is left up to you.

The following technologies have to be used:
* React
* Redux
* TypeScript

Beware! The backend is unreliable, so you need to prepare for your requests to not be accepted!

Just run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and your server will start at `localhost:9000`. You can change the port in `./src/constants.js`.

## Good luck and have fun!
